ðŸ¤“ Hey there, fellow tech enthusiast! ðŸ¤“

My name is Tom and I'm an engineering student in France. I'm excited to be a part of this community and share my skills and knowledge with you all.

A little bit about me:

- When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me on my computer, trying to fugure out how to draw a BSpline or geeking out over video games.
- I'm also passionate about using technology to create visual things, to innovate or just developping useless sh*t.
- As an engineering student, I have a strong background in Maths or Physics, but also in general computer science. I also like to start code projects that I'll never see the end of, but it's these kinds of out-of-school projects that are really formative, since I'm free to develop what I want and make all the mistakes I want without getting beaten up by my classmates who are going to review my code.
I'm always up for a good challenge and love collaborating on projects, so don't be shy! Drop me a line if you want to work together or just chat. I'm also open to new work experience, feel free to write me a loving message :)

(yup, that's a motivational quote i like, stay motivated boy, you're working for your dream life)

Stay cool,
